## PC with Excitatory/Inhibitory Constraints
Corresponding to https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11063-017-9677-4

## Features:
  - Implemented constraints of circuit, particularly on:
    * Incoming connections to circuits.
    * Inner connections of circuits.
    * Outgoing connections from circuits.

## Main files:
